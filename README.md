# Edspressoâ˜•

Edspresso - a web application designed to enhance the skills and knowledge of coffee shop baristas while reducing training costs. Our application has three main features: Train, Test, and Track.

## Features

Edspresso has three main features:

* Train: With the Train feature, coffee shop owners can assign lessons for their baristas to learn. Baristas can access the lessons and complete them at their own pace.

* Test: The Test feature allows baristas to take quizzes and test their knowledge. The quizzes are designed to reinforce the lessons and help baristas retain the information.

* Track: With the Track feature, coffee shop owners can monitor the progress of each barista and see analytical statistics for each assigned lesson. This feature helps coffee shop owners identify areas where baristas may need additional training.
