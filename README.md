## Features

* Test: The Test feature allows baristas to take quizzes and test their knowledge. The quizzes are designed to reinforce the lessons and help baristas retain the information.

* Track: With the Track feature, coffee shop owners can monitor the progress of each barista and see analytical statistics for each assigned lesson. This feature helps coffee shop owners identify areas where baristas may need additional training.
